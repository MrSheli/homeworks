    <p> During <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_Gillingham_F.C._season" >F.C. 1984–85 season</a>, they competed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Third_Division"> 
        League Third Division</a>, the third tier of the English football league 
        system. It was the 53rd season in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system" >competed in the Football</a>
        League, and the 35th since they were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-election_(Football_League)">  voted back into the league</a> in 1950.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillingham_F.C."> Gillingham</a> started the season with five wins in the first seven games
        and were challenging for a place in the top three of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking">league table</a>
        which would result in promotion to the Second Division. The team's performances
        then declined, and by November they were in mid-table. They won 12
        out of 16 games to go back up to second place, before a poor run 
        in March meant that they again dropped out of the promotion places.
        Gillingham finished the season fourth in the table, missing promotion 
        by one place. They also competed in three knock-out competitions,
        winning no trophies, but won three times to reach the fourth round of the 
        1984–85 FA Cup before losing. The team played 56 competitive matches,
        and won 30. </p>
